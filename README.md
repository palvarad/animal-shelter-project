# animal-shelter-project
Animal Shelter Project Repository:

Make a new project and place the animalShelterManager inside your src folder and it should work.

**Text File Format:**

All the different attributes can be separated using semicolons and that should make it easier to read the correct info.

FirstName LastName ; Info1 ; Info2 ; Info3 ; Info4

Changes that need/should be done:

* No digits allowed for name input.

* Display customer information when the telephone number matches an existing customer.

* Add returns to the menus that do not currently have returns.

* Notify the manager/employee when inventory for an item is below 10.

* Add the month number when prompting for the expected inventory sales.
